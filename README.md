# Graphics Engine

I'm trying my hand at a graphics engine in C++. I have little experience in the language and almost no knowledge of computer graphics, but I'm trying my best. I'm working out of [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics, Fourth Edition by Peter Shirley and Steve Marschner](https://github.com/t4world/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/Fundamentals-of-Computer-Graphics-Fourth-Edition.pdf).

Wish me luck.

So far, this program encompasses everything from Chapter 4 on Ray Tracing. The following render uses Blinn-Phong and Lambert shading on the spheres and a modified form of "Ideal Specular Shading" for the plane.
